# Selection Sort

Selection Sort is a simple **comparison-based sorting algorithm** used to arrange elements of an array in **ascending order**.

---

## 📌 What is Selection Sort?

Selection Sort works by **repeatedly selecting the smallest element** from the unsorted part of the array and placing it at the correct position in the sorted part.

The array is divided into two parts:

* **Sorted part** (left side)
* **Unsorted part** (right side)

## ❓ Why Selection Sort is Used?

Selection Sort is mainly used to:

* Understand basic sorting concepts
* Learn how swapping and comparisons work
* Practice array traversal and nested loops
* Build logic for more advanced sorting algorithms

---

## 🧠 How Selection Sort Works

1. Assume the first element is the minimum
2. Compare it with all remaining elements
3. Find the smallest element in the unsorted part
4. Swap it with the first element
5. Move to the next position
6. Repeat until the array is sorted

## ⚠ Important Characteristics

* Works on **unsorted arrays**
* Sorting is done **in-place**
* Not suitable for large datasets
* Not a stable sorting algorithm

---

## ⏱ Time and Space Complexity

* **Time Complexity:** O(n²)

  * Best Case: O(n²)
  * Worst Case: O(n²)
* **Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

## ✅ When to Use Selection Sort

* For small datasets
* For learning and practice purposes
* When memory usage needs to be minimal

---

## ❌ When Not to Use Selection Sort

* For large datasets
* When performance is critical

---

## 📌 Summary

Selection Sort is easy to understand and implement, making it ideal for **DSA beginners**, but it is inefficient for large-scale applications.
