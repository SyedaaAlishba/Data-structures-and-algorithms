# Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is a simple **comparison-based sorting algorithm** that repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

---

## 📌 What is Bubble Sort?

Bubble Sort works by **pushing the largest (or smallest) element to the end** of the array in each pass, just like bubbles rising to the surface.

After every iteration, the array becomes partially sorted.

---

## ❓ Why Bubble Sort is Used?

Bubble Sort is mainly used for:

* Understanding basic sorting logic
* Learning nested loops and swapping
* Detecting already sorted arrays
* Educational and practice purposes

---

## 🧠 How Bubble Sort Works

1. Compare the first two adjacent elements
2. Swap them if they are in the wrong order
3. Move to the next pair
4. Repeat the process for the entire array
5. After each pass, the largest element is placed at the end
6. Continue until the array is completely sorted

## 🔁 Variations Implemented

This implementation includes:

* **Bubble Sort (Ascending Order)**
* **Bubble Sort (Descending Order)**
* Optimization using a **swap counter** to detect if the array is already sorted

---

## ⚠ Important Characteristics

* Works on unsorted arrays
* Sorting is done **in-place**
* Simple but inefficient for large datasets
* Stable sorting algorithm

---

## ⏱ Time and Space Complexity

* **Best Case:** O(n) (already sorted array, optimized)
* **Average Case:** O(n²)
* **Worst Case:** O(n²)
* **Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

## ✅ When to Use Bubble Sort

* For small datasets
* For learning and practice
* When simplicity is more important than performance

---

## ❌ When Not to Use Bubble Sort

* For large datasets
* When high performance is required

---

## 📌 Summary

Bubble Sort is easy to understand and implement, making it ideal for **DSA beginners**, but it is not suitable for large-scale applications due to its high time complexity.
