# 📌 Singly Linked List Application (C++)

## 📖 Overview

This project is a **console-based C++ application** that demonstrates the implementation of a **Singly Linked List** data structure. The program allows users to interact with the list through a menu-driven interface and perform common linked list operations.

The goal of this project is to build a strong understanding of **dynamic memory management, pointers, and fundamental data structure operations**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Understand how linked lists store data dynamically
* Practice pointer manipulation
* Implement core linked list operations
* Learn how to build menu-driven console programs

---

## 🧠 Data Structure Used

### Singly Linked List

A singly linked list is a linear data structure where each element (node) contains:

* **Data** – the value stored in the node
* **Next pointer** – a reference to the next node in the sequence

The list starts from a **head pointer** and continues until a node points to `NULL`, indicating the end.

## ⚙️ Features

The application provides the following functionalities:

### ➕ Insert Data

Allows the user to add a new value to the linked list.
New nodes are added dynamically at runtime.

### 📄 Display List

Shows all the elements currently stored in the linked list in sequence.

### 🔍 Search Element

Checks whether a specific value exists in the list and displays an appropriate message.

### ❌ Delete Element

Removes a node containing a specified value from the linked list.

### 🚪 Exit

Terminates the program safely.

## 🖥️ How the Program Works

1. The program starts by displaying a menu of operations.
2. The user selects an option by entering a number.
3. The chosen linked list operation is performed.
4. The menu reappears until the user chooses to exit.

This loop allows continuous interaction without restarting the program.

## 🧩 Concepts Practiced

This project helps in understanding:

* Dynamic memory allocation
* Pointer traversal
* Node creation and deletion
* Linear data structures
* Searching algorithms
* Menu-driven program design

---

## 🚀 Learning Outcomes

After completing this project, a learner should be able to:

✔ Explain how singly linked lists work
✔ Implement basic linked list operations
✔ Manage memory using dynamic allocation
✔ Traverse and manipulate nodes using pointers

---

## 🔮 Possible Enhancements

This project can be extended by adding more advanced features such as:

* Inserting at the beginning or at a specific position
* Counting total nodes
* Reversing the linked list
* Sorting the list
* Converting the program to use classes (Object-Oriented Programming)
