## Linear Search Algorithm

This repository contains a simple implementation of the **Linear Search** algorithm using **C++**.

---

## 📌 What is Linear Search?

Linear Search is a basic searching algorithm that checks **each element of an array one by one** until the target value is found or the array ends.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

* To understand the working of Linear Search
* To practice array traversal using functions
* To learn basic searching logic in DSA

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Start from the first element of the array
2. Compare each element with the target value
3. If a match is found, return its index
4. If the loop ends and no match is found, display **NOT FOUND**
